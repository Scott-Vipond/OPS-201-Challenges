###Inputs:

This repo (OPS-201-Challenges) was created for the Code Fellows Ops and Cybersecurity OPS 201 class.  We had daily code challenges to stretch our experience in coding and provide some initial exposure to that aspect of IT.

The skills we practiced will enable automation of tasks if needed in future system administrative positions such as installing new desktop computer remotely, activating group policies, or ensure security features are updated and turned on.  Additionally, we become familiar with reading code to identify variables, loops, functions, etc. in Bash and Powershell.

I have a hard time picking a “favorite” challenge because to be honest, most of them were fairly difficult and frustrating at times.  I think the ones which require asking the user for input were interesting because they became a script “game” trying to make useful product for an individual.

If given the time/opportunity, I would continue to hone my skills using functions because I see that being the most useful way to automate tasks in Powershell.

Improvement area for me might have to wait for Python in the next classes.  The language seems to be used more often and is more intuitive regarding the syntax.  Otherwise, Powershell would be useful because end-user machines will be running some version of Windows and automation for that keeps me working smarter not harder.
